<p>This is a project I created for my ICS 31 class for Professor Yeh. </p>
<p>You traverse the map by utilizing data read from a JSON file. In addition, the JSON file includes objects which you can pick up.</p>
<p>This game also has the ability to save and load player data (inventory and location), based on their username. </p>
